# Linked List-Based Account Management System

This project implements a **Linked List-based Account Management System** in the C programming language. It showcases the use of the **linked list data structure** to manage a collection of accounts dynamically and efficiently. 

## Features
- **Add Accounts:** Insert new accounts at the beginning, end, or after a specific node in the list.
- **Search Accounts:** Find accounts by account number or type (e.g., Savings, Current).
- **Update Accounts:** Deposit amounts directly into an account.
- **Delete Accounts:** Remove accounts dynamically, ensuring list integrity.
- **Display Accounts:** View all accounts or filter by specific account types.
  
## Key Concepts
The project emphasizes the power of **linked lists**, providing:
- Dynamic memory management.
- Flexibility in node insertion and deletion.
- Practical use cases for singly linked lists in account management.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Core Data Structure:** Singly Linked List
- **Standard Library Functions:** Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`), string handling (`strcpy`, `fgets`), and file handling (optional).

## Why Linked Lists?
Unlike arrays, linked lists allow dynamic allocation, making them ideal for applications where the size of the data collection is unknown or subject to frequent changes. This project demonstrates these advantages in a practical context.
